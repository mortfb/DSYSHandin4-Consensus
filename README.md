To run the program, each node should be run on separate terminals. Inside the terminals, execute go run node.go, which is located inside the nodes folder. When the file gets executed, type in a port number into the terminal, which would be 5050 for the first node, 5051 for the second node and 5052 for the third node. There can only be three nodes running at a time, no more nor any less.
